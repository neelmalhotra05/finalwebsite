# Task 1: About me *(Click for dropdown)*

Hey Guys, I am Akshat. You could pronouce it as "Uck-Shuh" or "j-aim-es
bo-nd"

## My undergraduate life

An undergraduate degree in computer science introduced me to programming
and data-oriented courses. So now am going to make the toughest choice
of my life - Get a consulting/Tech job after the MAM **or open my own
bar and spend the rest of my life serving drinks for the greater good of
mankind.**

Being brought up around a family business gave me a business outlook.
Being exposed to both these elements at a young age made me realize the
importance of having the right set of analytical as well as management
skills to succeed. The Masters in Analytics and Management programme
will help me learn how to utilize both these skills to my advantage
*(but even after the rigorous 1 year if I do not manage to learn the
balance - I'll just use the LBS brand name, expensive LBS merchandise
and secure a high paying job).*

During my second year at undergraduate engineering college, I founded my
own start up with three other friends, we made some money, it was not
enough so I took up a job at Barclays where I still did not make enough
money. I also had a team research project for which we created an award
winning brain controlled wheelchair. I swear I do not have a god complex
but I would definitely like to move things with my mind

## Me professionally

At Barclays I joined the Insurance team and started developing software
using various technologies for: 1. Database manipulation 2. Test
automation 3. User experience 4. Digital accessibility for the disabled.
5. We used Agile methodologies, primarily the scrum framework and sprint
cycles + I very well understand how the chronology of my biography is
not off track but I really wanted to use my experience at Barclays to
seem a little professional.

## My goals in cool words.

In the short term I want to learn how to fully utilize the potential of
data in order to drive a successful business or product. Professionally,
I would like to holistically understand how businesses work and develop
an expertise in leveraging data to launch innovative products. I want to
work in technology consulting with top firms such as Bain & Company,
McKinsey or BCG. My skill set would include understanding client
requirements, performing quantitative and qualitative analysis,
presenting a concrete technological solution and devising implementation
strategies. In the long term I would like to have my own bar, learn how
to fly and spend all the money I made using the LBS brand name.

Cheers and have great day guys, if you really spent your time reading
the whole biography - come home & I will compensate you with a beer :)
