       x = "born in UK",
       y = "leave share") +
  NULL
```
 

The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are positively correlated.


Looking at the graphs and plots, we can say there is positive correlation between people born in Uk and its leave share. Graph implies about 50% of the native residents were supporting Brexit. There might be a possibility people in areas where migration rate is low have higher proportion of leave voters compared to areas with high migration rate. So, immigration could be a major factor impacting the brexit result.
