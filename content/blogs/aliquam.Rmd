Me with my family(homesickness level - ∞)

Early Life
Hey there, I am Neel Malhotra! I was born & brought up in New Delhi, India and before coming to LBS for the MFA, I studied the most generic subjects(Accounting & Finance) at the University of Delhi.

Work Experience
My area of interest has always been finance , so for "obvious reasons", I took up a consulting job with Bain & Company after my Bachelors. But through a stroke of luck & some interview prep I was able to take up internal positions initially for 9 months with the M&A practice and then for my final 3 months, got a promotion to the coveted Private Equity Group.

Future Career Goals
Get a PE Analyst job
Get an IB/Consulting job and then switch to PE
die? (gotta happen one day)

Sports and Athletics
After battling my minor fear of water, I was forced to choose a sport by my *Indian* parents and I took up swimming and after 2 years of rigorous training, I was ranked 5th All India in my main stroke, Butterfly and also consistently ranked in the top 5 at the National Triathlons from 2015-2018.

Wanting to hone my leadership skills, I also took up Water Polo and was elected to become the Vice-Captain of my state’s national finalist team.

Social Work
After the demise of my grandmother due to Cancer, my entire family was shaken, and we understood that lack of awareness of medical treatments and people resigning themselves to their fate. So, in 2019, I started an NGO called Cancer Prevention and Detection Foundation to spread awareness about cancer and conduct health check-up camps and seminars with leading institutes in India like Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute.
