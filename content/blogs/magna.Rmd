# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?


Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alcohol consumption in different countries. We will investigate which countries drink the most beer, wine and spirits. First we will load the data.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```


Now that we have loaded the data, we will check the variable types and for missing values.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
skimr::skim(drinks)
```

> We have one character and four numeric variables. We don't have any missing values.

Here is a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries:

```{r beer_plot}
drinks %>% 
  select(country, beer_servings)%>%
  slice_max(order_by=beer_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    y=fct_reorder(country,beer_servings), # Orders countries in descending order of beer servings
    x=beer_servings)
    )+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    x="Beer servings", 
    y="Country",
    title="Top 25 beer-consuming countries")+
  NULL

```

Here are the top 25 wine consuming countries:

```{r wine_plot}

drinks %>% 
  select(country, wine_servings)%>%
  slice_max(order_by=wine_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    y=fct_reorder(country,wine_servings), 
    x=wine_servings)
    )+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
  x="Wine servings", 
  y="Country",
  title="Top 25 wine-consuming countries")+
  NULL

```

Finally, here is a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries:
```{r spirit_plot}

drinks %>% 
  select(country, spirit_servings)%>%
  slice_max(order_by=spirit_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    y=fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings), 
    x=spirit_servings)
    )+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    x="Spirit servings", 
    y="Country",
    title="Top 25 spirit-consuming countries")+
  NULL

```

Looking at the graphs above, we can infer that different countries are specialised in production of different kinds of alcohol. Countries which have been historically strong in agriculture (Germany, Czech Republic, Poland) have higher beer production. Similarly, countries like France & Portugal have a favorable climate for wine production, which could have eventually become part of their culture. From a macroeconomic perspective, countries tend to specialise in what they are strong in, which we can observe in these graphs as well. In addition, poorer countries tend to consume stronger alcohol; we can observe Grenada, Belarus, Russia are the top 3 consumers of spirits.
